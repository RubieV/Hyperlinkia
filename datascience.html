                Data science is the extraction of knowledge from data. But what does that entail precisely? Data
                scientists use data, sets of little parts of information, to find meaningful knowledge. This is
                done by recognizing patterns in the data.
            </p>
            <p>
                For example, suppose there is a set of scores of angriness. With these scores you’d able to compare
                male scores to female scores and you could conclude who are angrier. We wouldn’t have been able to
                conclude this from just individual scores; we would have had to compare them and use statistical methods.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="info col-md-4">
            <p>
                Data science, however, is not the same as statistics, but they do have a lot in common. In data
                science, we are mainly interested in very big and complicated data sets: Big Data.
            </p>
            <p>
                This Big Data is becoming increasingly more important as more and more people begin to see the benefit
                of using it. The amount of data increases significantly as well, and consequenly so do the
                possibilities of using it.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="info col-md-4">
            <p>
                There is a lot involved in the process of data science. Data scientists therefore need a lot of
                skills. To be able to work with data, you will need basic
                <a class="page-scroll" href="#maths">mathematical and statistical</a> and
                <a class="page-scroll" href="#computer">computer science</a> knowledge.
            </p>
            <p>
                Those are the theoretical backgrounds that every data scientist should have. For data scientists
                <a class="page-scroll" href="#domain">domain specific</a> knowledge is also a necessity.
            </p>
            <p>
                For example, a lot of data scientists work in the business sector. With just the  basic knowledge of
                data science they won’t come far: they also need business know-how. In the
                <a href="study.html#submenu"> bachelor of Data Science </a> at the TU/e you are be able
                learn about all of these disciplines.

        <h2>Mathematics & Statistics</h2>

        <div class="info col-md-6">
            <p>
                Mathematics and statistics can be seen as the fundament of data science. In fact, statistics and
                data science are often used interchangeably. In both sciences, data is used to extract
                knowledge.
            </p>
            <p>
                In data science however, the use of computational methods is way more extensive. This
                is what makes data science a very powerful tool: when the data is complicated, or there is just
                A LOT of data, data scientists can still work with it while pure statisticians pinch.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="info col-md-6">
            <p>
                An engineer should never purely rely on computations. Computational programs are not flawless and
                data scientists should know how to detect and solve problems. For this, data scientists need
                mathematics and statistics.
            </p>
            <p>
                Statistics and mathematics are hence very important areas in

        <h2>Computer Science</h2>

        <div class="info col-md-4">
            <p>
                To work with data, computer science is a must. Computer science is the science of computation.
                Computatations are calculations with computers.
            </p>
            <p>
                A lot of data is gathered, stored, processed and
                visualized by computing. Data science is thus quite heavy on computer science. Computer science in data
                science is a two-edged sword: it consists primarly of programming and data specific knowledge. You need
                programming knowledge to formalize computing methods.
            </p>
            <p>
                Data specific knowledge is needed to determine
                what computing methods to use. Data scientists usually collect already existing data. This seems quite
                easy, but it sure isn’t. Not all data is relevant and usable. In data science, a major subject is how to
                collect useful data in an efficient way. This is often done with computing methods.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="info col-md-4">
            <p>
                Acquired data should be kept somewhere. This should be done very securely. Imagine that competitors could
                steal data regarding a new product - this would be disastrous.
            </p>
            <p>
                The management of data is therefore very
                important. Data scientists should know how to store this data on servers and alike in a professional
                way. When the data is collected and stored, it still has to be processed. Often, acquired data sets are
                complicated and big.
            </p>
            <p>
                The data is then processed with algorithms; programs that compute in a
                predetermined manner. Data scientists should know how the algorithms work, as they regularly have to
                make their own algorithms. The knowledge is also need if they have to solve emerging problems.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="info col-md-4">
            <p>
                After finding results, data scientists often have to present them to unknowing audiences. Next to
                communication, proper visualizations of data and results are then necessary.
            </p>
            <p>
                These visualizations are often made with computers. Imagine the struggle of plotting thousands of points
                in a small graph. Computers are just way faster and preciser than humans in that case. In the process of
                <a class="page-scroll" href="#submenu"> data science </a>, computer science is clearly heavily used.
            </p>

        <h2>Domain Specific</h2>

        <div class="info col-md-6">
            <p>
                Data science is an applied science. It is used in business, economics, research, government… The
                list goes on. Skills and knowledge from these fields are really necessary to Data scientists.
            </p>
            <p>
                Analyzing data is not enough: the results should also be interpreted. This is simply not
                possible without domain specific knowledge. On more positive note, the possible
                <a href="careers.html#submenu"> careers </a> as a data scientist are diverse and pay well.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="info col-md-6">
            <p>
                When working in different fields, co-workers, clients and bosses don’t often have a lot of
                <a class="page-scroll" href="#submenu"> data science </a> know-how. Data scientists should then
                also be able to explain their work and results to others.
            </p>
            <p>
                Communication is a very big part of this. Just like in relationships, communication is the key to
                success. In the <a href="study.html#electives"> elective courses </a> of the bachelor of Data Science at
                the TU/e, a lot of domain specific knowledge is taught.
