                In a world that is changing more rapidly than ever, the digital universe is expanding even
                faster. By 2020 there will be nearly as many digital bits of data as there are stars in the
                universe.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is doubling in size every two years, and by 2020 the digital universe – the data we
                create and copy annually – will reach 44 zettabytes, or 44 trillion gigabytes. To manage this
                huge pile of data and to keep our digital environment under control, it is of vital importance
                that data engineers guide us through the ever expanding maze of data.

                    Your study will consist of three
                    years of four quartiles each. In turn, every quartile includes 2 major learning blocks which
                    will treat different aspects of the Data Science field and train basic skills in an in-depth
                    manner.

                <p class="info">
                    The subjects in these learning blocks can belong to 4 different categories; Data
                    Courses, Math & Statistics, Programming and Electives.

                    Students can choose electives while they take career possibilities into consideration. For
                    example, if you are interested in scientific research, you could take Research Methodology as an
                    elective. For more information about electives, visit the

                The <a class="page-scroll" href="#submenu">bachelor study of Data Science</a> provides a good basis for everyone wishing to become a data
                scientist, but data Science has many fields of research. So many, that some disciplines within
                Data Science are not covered by the standard bachelor program, because we simply cannot fit the
                extensive domain of Data Science in a 3-year study.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, different <a href="careers.html#submenu">careers</a> can require different knowledge. For example, a career path in business
                requires skills in law and economics, while conducting data research requires more methodological and
                skills. Furthermore, the remaining subjects are very interesting as well. Therefore, you can make your
                choice from a selection of elective courses that can prepare you for your master or can broaden
                your scientific horizon.
            </p>

                    The elective Communication Technology will focus more in depth on computer- and communication
                    networks and software which enables users to access, store, transmit, and manipulate

                    A company is always in need of someone who can take care of the facts and figures. Whether it is
                    keeping track of the financial side or trying to improve production processes, a Data Scientist
                    can always do the job. The Business elective will focus on the economic side of Data Science and
                    other company-related disciplines.

                    In all sciences and industries where it is too expensive to spontaneously test adaptions in
                    existing systems, models have to be made to predict what will happen and what should be done to
                    optimize that system. To make valid assumptions and an adequate prediction of the future, there
                    needs to me sufficient data from the present. In Advanced Modelling you will practice using and
                    creating models and incorporating numbers and figures into them.

                    structures like DNA, chromosomes or about the structure of diseases.

                    governments with useful information. In the Social Media elective, you will learn how you can
                    extract data from social media like facebook, youtube or twitter and use this data to draw
                    relevant conclusions.

                skills that you have learned throughout the year into practice. Group projects also form an
                opportunity to refresh your knowledge from earlier years without having to do the whole course
